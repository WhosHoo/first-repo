# My first repository

My favourite super power is elemental bender power allowing me to use earth, fire, air, and water. Depending on the mood, I can feel like using any of the elemental powers (i.e fire to travel places or water cool mysef during the summer). The main element I would use is earth because it could correlate to using metal element.
